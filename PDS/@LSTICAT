//*     LISTICAT   --     An upgrade to the LISTICAT program        *
//*                       originally found on file 047.             *
//*                       This one has major changes to the         *
//*                       report layout among other things.         *
//*                                                                 *   FILE 527
//*                LISTICAT was an old program lifted from file     *   FILE 527
//*                047.  It accesses the ICF catalog BCS and VVDS   *   FILE 527
//*                as data files instead of using the SHOWCB        *   FILE 527
//*                macros.  This program has had its report changed *   FILE 527
//*                to display many more fields, yet still keep the  *   FILE 527
//*                one-line format.                                 *   FILE 527
//*                                                                 *   FILE 527
//*                At this time the HEXPRINT function is seriously  *   FILE 527
//*                broken.  It will be re-written at a future date  *   FILE 527
//*                and integrated more fully into the program.      *   FILE 527
